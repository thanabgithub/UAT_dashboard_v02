This is my first web app project which covers frontend and backend. Basically, I tried some techniques following the course "Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp" taught by Bogdan Stashchuk from Udamy and other materials available online.

For react JS, I learned how to use

1. react-bootstrap

    Eventhough it has difficulty to do the styling via pure CSS comparing to styled-components, I think it is a good library for a beginner like me to start with because it provides ready-to-use components which are really convinients.

2. setState
    
    I used the function for control search form and deliver the value to plot chart via HighChart
    
4. component's customization via CSS

    I learned how to override styles from react-bootstrap using scss.
    
For this project, I haven't launch the live demo because I think I'd better spend time on developing my web app skills since there are still many things I'm missing around here.

What I'm looking forward to improving myself is to be more familar to use states, beautify component and learn how to develop sidebar in the next project.
